### Summary about myself

Changing the field of activity is like starting everything from scratch. It is always interesting to start, it means new knowledge, opportunities, interests and acquaintances.
I have worked as a freelancer for 3 years, designing websites, mobile and web applications.
Soon, after a long work as a Web designer, I was eager to build my career in IT, as a web developer, because my skills are a great opportunity to achieve what I want.
