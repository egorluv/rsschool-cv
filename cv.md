### Summary about myself

Changing the field of activity is like starting everything from scratch. It is always interesting to start - it means new knowledge, opportunities, interests and acquaintances.

I have worked as a freelancer for 3 years, designing websites, mobile and web applications.

Soon, after a long work as a web designer, I was eager to build my career in IT, as a web developer, because my skills and qualities are a great opportunity to achieve what I want.

***My priority qualities are:***

* Analytical mind  
* Engineering approach to problem solving  
* Ability to competently educate people, translate the lessons learned  
* Experience in commercial negotiations
